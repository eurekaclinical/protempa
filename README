Protempa 2.0.1 -- A Temporal Query Framework for Clinical Databases
Center for Comprehensive Informatics, Emory University

OVERVIEW

Welcome to Protempa! It supports the construction of software systems for 
querying clinical databases, summarizing patient data, detecting clinically 
significant data patterns in groups of patients or individual patients, and 
extract, transform and load (ETL). Its special feature, temporal abstraction,
supports queries and summarization of data in terms of temporal patterns. 
Temporal patterns enable robust querying and extraction of clinical history. 
These patterns include frequencies (at least two, three, etc. of some event or
observation); sequences (chemotherapy followed by surgery within 180 days,
a hospital encounter followed by another hospital encounter within 30 days); 
and overlaps (falling platelet counts in the setting of HELLP syndrome).
Protempa is the foundation for the Eureka! Clinical Analytics tool, available
from http://eureka.cci.emory.edu.

WHAT'S NEW

Version 2.0.1 improves support for specifying property constraints in temporal
abstraction definitions, for example, encounters with a type of Inpatient. This
release allows using pre-property constraint temporal abstraction ontologies
that lack the propertyConstraint slot.

REQUIREMENTS

The current version is known to work with Oracle Java 6. It is expected to work
with OpenJDK 6 as well. It is incompatible with Java 7. 

Protempa uses the Maven build system, available from http://maven.apache.org. 
You must install maven, if you do not already have it, to work with the source 
code. We use Maven 3.

INSTALLATION

The easiest way to get Protempa is using Maven. It is available from 
the http://maven.cci.emory.edu:8081 repository. Use the following dependency
declaration:

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.protempa</groupId>
  <artifactId>protempa</artifactId>
